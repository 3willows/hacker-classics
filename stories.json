HN! I love imagining the past, so I made Time Portal, a game where you are dropped into a historical event and see AI video footage from that moment. You have to guess where you are in time and on the map. It’s like GeoGuessr (and heavily inspired by it!) but for historical events.<p>The videos are all created with AI. It’s a pipeline of Flux (images), Kling (video), and mmaudio (audio). The videos aren’t always historically accurate to the last detail. They might incorporate elements of folklore or have details from popular beliefs about the way things looked rather than the latest academic research on how they looked.<p>I’m thinking a lot about how to make the game more interactive. One thing that makes Geoguessr so fun for me is that you can move infinitely and always find more details to help you pinpoint the location. I want Time Portal to have a similar quality.

I love imagining the past, so I made Time Portal, a game where you are dropped into a historical event and see AI video footage from that moment.

It’s a pipeline of Flux (images), Kling (video), and mmaudio (audio). The videos aren’t always historically accurate to the last detail.

a software engineer, mainly working on mobile apps (iOS primarily) through React Native and some Swift/Java. I have a CS degree and about 7 years in this field.<p>However recently I've become very aware that JS/TS and Swift etc are just APIs on top of APIs. I've been drawn to learning more about how computers work, the <em>history</em> of programming/computers (Unix, Sinclair, commodore, etc and even going back to Ada Lovelace, Babbage and mainframes in the 1950s) and things like memory allocation. I've tried learning some BASIC and Assembly code but haven't really got very far. I read/devour articles on sites like https://twobithistory.org but they only get you so far.<p>What can I do to help accelerate this and satiate this desire to learn more about how computers work? I live in London, UK and would be happy to spend some money on a uni course or something if there was a good one.
